Description: Typically, when using doing methylation predictions, there are 450k number
        of CpGs, how to select predictors is a tricky problem. Usually, people choose
        CpGs that are most significant or CpGs with most varilibity, here we present
        a new method using differential methylation regions to select CpGs as prodictors.
